# AI Prompting Guide Template

This repository contains a structured template for creating effective AI interactions. The `GUIDE.txt` file provides a framework that helps you clearly define context, rules, and expected outputs when working with AI assistants.

## Template Structure

The guide template consists of five main sections:

### 1. CONTEXT
- Describe the situation, problem, or goal you want to achieve
- Be specific about what you're trying to accomplish

### 2. RULES
- **How should the AI act?** - Define the role, perspective, or experience level
- Trick: one good trick is that you can ask it to explain everything to you like you're a 5 year old.
- **Skillset/knowledge scope** - List relevant tools, languages, frameworks, or areas
- **Restrictions or boundaries** - Specify what should not be touched or altered

### 3. PROCESSING
- Review the provided codebase/project/data/context
- Identify relevant elements, requirements, or constraints
- Plan the approach within the given rules and restrictions

### 4. OUTPUT
- **Style guide** - Define the tone and complexity level
- **Formatting rules** - Specify any formatting restrictions or preferences
- **Deliverables** - List what should be provided (code, instructions, diagrams, etc.)

### 5. POST PROCESSING
- Rescan, Review and Re-evaluate if there is all there is or any missing component.

## Example Usage

The `EXAMPLE.txt` file includes a practical example of containerizing a Python web application. This demonstrates how to:

- Set clear context for a DevOps task
- Define the AI's role as an experienced engineer explaining to beginners
- Specify the required skillset (Python, Flask, Docker, SQLite3)
- Set boundaries (protecting production data)
- Define the expected output format and deliverables

## Benefits

Using this template helps you:
- Get more accurate and relevant AI responses
- Set clear expectations for the interaction
- Avoid misunderstandings about scope and boundaries
- Ensure the AI provides output in your preferred format and style

## Getting Started

1. Copy the template structure from `GUIDE.txt`
2. Fill in your specific context and requirements
3. Use the completed guide when interacting with AI assistants
4. Adjust the template based on your specific use cases

This structured approach leads to more productive AI interactions and better results for your projects.
